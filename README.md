# sipblocklist

This blocklist was previously hosted on my website at https://www.gofferje.net.

I'm running an asterisk PBX at home since 2001. Over the years, the attempts to use it without authorization have increased massively. As far as I could find, there is no free publicly available blocklist to use with SIP enables PBXs, so I decidede to create one.

This list is updated automatically out of my firewall every 6 hours. It contains all IP addresses which tried to either brute-force user accounts on my PBX or make unauthorized calls during the last 30 days.
